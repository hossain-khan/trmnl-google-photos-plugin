- keyname: shared_album_url
  field_type: url
  name: Google Photos Shared Album URL
  description: "Paste your Google Photos shared album link (e.g., https://photos.app.goo.gl/ABC123)"
  placeholder: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/..."
  default: ""
  optional: true
  help_text: To create a shared album, open Google Photos → Create → Shared Album → Get Link. Ensure link sharing is enabled. Leave blank to see a demo photo.
- keyname: custom_title
  field_type: string
  name: Display Name
  description: "Custom name to show in the title bar (optional)"
  placeholder: "My Google Photos"
  default: ""
  optional: true
  help_text: This name appears in the plugin's title bar. Leave blank to use the plugin name (Google Photos Shared Album).
- keyname: show_year
  field_type: boolean
  default: true
  optional: true
  name: Show Photo Year
  description: "Display the photo year in the bottom right corner"
  help_text: When enabled, the year from the photo's date appears in the bottom right corner with a white stroke for visibility. Disable if you prefer a cleaner photo display.
- keyname: show_metadata
  field_type: boolean
  default: true
  optional: true
  name: Show Photo Details
  description: "Display photo date, size, and count in the title bar"
  help_text: When enabled, shows photo details like date, size, and total count (e.g., '2 years ago • 12MP • 142 photos'). When disabled, only shows photo count for a cleaner look.
- keyname: adaptive_background
  field_type: boolean
  default: false
  optional: true
  name: Adaptive Background
  description: "Match background color to photo for seamless display"
  help_text: When enabled, the background shade adapts to each photo based on edge brightness for a more immersive look. Adds ~100-200ms to loading time. Disable for default white background. Works best with fullbleed layouts.
- keyname: enable_caching
  field_type: boolean
  default: true
  optional: true
  name: Enable Performance Caching
  description: "Save photo information temporarily for faster loading (recommended)"
  help_text: When enabled, we temporarily remember which photos are in your album for 1 hour so everything loads instantly. Your actual photos are never saved - we just remember they exist. Disable this to always fetch fresh photos directly from Google (takes a few seconds longer, but nothing is saved).

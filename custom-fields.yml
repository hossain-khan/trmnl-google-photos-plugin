- keyname: shared_album_url
  field_type: url
  name: Google Photos Shared Album URL
  description: "Paste your Google Photos shared album link (e.g., https://photos.app.goo.gl/ABC123)"
  placeholder: "https://photos.app.goo.gl/..."
  default: ""
  optional: true
  help_text: To create a shared album, open Google Photos → Create → Shared Album → Get Link. Ensure link sharing is enabled. Leave blank to see a demo photo.
- keyname: custom_title
  field_type: string
  name: Display Name
  description: "Custom name to show in the title bar (optional)"
  placeholder: "My Google Photos"
  default: ""
  optional: true
  help_text: This name appears in the plugin's title bar. Leave blank to use the plugin name (Google Photos Shared Album).
- keyname: show_year
  field_type: boolean
  default: true
  optional: true
  name: Show Photo Year
  description: "Display the photo year in the bottom right corner"
  help_text: When enabled, the year from the photo's date appears in the bottom right corner with a white stroke for visibility. Disable if you prefer a cleaner photo display.
- keyname: show_metadata
  field_type: boolean
  default: true
  optional: true
  name: Show Photo Metadata
  description: "Display photo date, resolution, and count in the title bar"
  help_text: When enabled, shows photo metadata in the title bar (e.g., '2 years ago • 12MP • 142 photos'). When disabled, only shows photo count as a separate badge for a minimal display.
- keyname: enable_caching
  field_type: boolean
  default: true
  optional: true
  name: Enable Performance Caching
  description: "Cache album metadata for faster loading (recommended for most users)"
  help_text: When enabled, album metadata (photo URLs) is cached for 1 hour to improve performance by 80%. Your photos are never stored—only the list of photo URLs is temporarily cached. Disable this to ensure zero data is stored anywhere along the process—every request will fetch fresh data directly from Google Photos (slower loading 2-3 seconds vs 100ms, but maximum privacy guaranteed).
